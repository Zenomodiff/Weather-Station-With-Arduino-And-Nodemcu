# Weather-Station-With-Arduino-Nodemcu-
This Weather Station Uses Arduino And Nodemcu , Since Nodemcu Have Only One A0 Pin & We Need Values From Different Analog Sensors Like :--

MQ2 --> Smoke 

MQ4 --> Cng

MQ5 --> Lpg

MQ135 --> Air Quality

LDR --> Light Intensity

Rain Sensor --> Rain Value

DHT 22  --> Temperature & Humidity

BMP280  --> Pressure & Altitude

We Use Json Library To Sent Values From Sensor's As "DOC" & Print It In Serial Monitor Of Nodemcu ,So The Job Is Easy
